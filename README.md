# Derrick's Terraform - AWS Lab

This is a simple lab environment for testing different server/software configurations deployed with Terraform in AWS.

# Networking

Networking consists of a VPC, that contains private and public subnets. The current configuration has all instances placed into the public subnet publicly reachable on port tcp port 22.

# EC2 Instances

Lab consists of two Rocky Linux 8 machines configured with separate user_data files. One machine is configured as a Samba server while the other instance mounts the Samba server's shares on startup. The Samba username is 'lab' with a random password generated by Terraform on instance creation and displayed as a Terraform output a well as being saved in TF's state file.

EC2 instanes use the AWS key-pair named *lab-keypair.pem* with the private key stored in *~/lab-keypair.pem*. When TF apply is ran SSH connection strings for each instance will be outputted.

TF state stored in AWS S3 bucket.
